(SPEECH) SPEAKER: What is commercial auto insurance? Whether it's delivering goods or meeting with customers, picking up supplies or transporting equipment to a job site, taking your business and your vehicles on the road can be essential to your everyday operations. Commercial auto insurance is designed to cover losses should you or an employee be involved in an accident when driving for work purposes.
You may be thinking you're covered under your personal auto policy, but it's not designed for the type of risks you and your employees can face. In fact, most personal auto policies contain an exclusion for business use. Commercial auto insurance can cover business-owned vehicles, like fleets of vehicles or trucks, and even your own car, as well as those you rent, lease, or borrow. It can also help when employees use their personal vehicles for business.
Commercial auto insurance isn't included in your business owners policy. But you can purchase it separately, and most states require businesses to have a minimum amount of commercial auto insurance. So make sure your business is protected from risks on the road. To get started with commercial auto coverage and other business insurance solutions, contact a Travelers independent agent or visit travelers.com.

Hired and Non-Owned Auto Coverages (HNOA)
What is hired and non-owned auto coverage?
Hired and non-owned auto (HNOA) coverage helps protect you, your business and your employees. If your business hires, rents or leases vehicles for work purposes, such as a van to move equipment or a car during a business trip, you need HNOA coverage.
Why do I need hired and non-owned auto coverage?
You need HNOA coverage because your business could be held liable if you or an employee is involved in an accident while driving for work purposes .
Using rented , hired or personal non-owned vehicles for work-related purposes expose s your business to risks. H elp protect your employees and your company with HNOA coverage .
Risks on the road
If you or an employee is involved in an accident while driving a rented auto, you could be liable if a lawsuit or claim is filed against your business. Even if your business doesn’t use hired vehicles, it may at some point. To cover that risk, you need to purchase the right commercial insurance to avoid a gap in coverage.
Commercial auto policies don’t automatically cover vehicles you don't own, even when you use those vehicles for business. That’s why you may need HNOA coverage.
A personal auto policy may provide some protection for an employee's personal auto used in your business. Important limitations differ by carrier. Check with your agent to learn more about HNOA coverage.

Minimizing business risks
Hired and non - owned auto insurance covers commercial auto liability damages ( settlements , judgments, attorney fees and other court costs ) . If employees operate vehicles for your business, HNOA coverage may be a wise investment.
Employee drivers represent your company – whether they drive every day or infrequently. It’s critical to uphold safety standards for all employees.

The right coverage is important
Regularly monitor how much employees are driving non-owned vehicles to make sure you have appropriate HNOA coverage.
F or example, restaurants making deliveries have a greater HNOA exposure and more risk . But sales people work ing from home , rather than on the road, may enable you to adjust your HNOA coverag e .
