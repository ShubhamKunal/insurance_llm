Common questions about commercial auto insurance
Get quick answers to some of the most asked questions about commercial auto insurance.
Does commercial auto insurance cover personal use?
Yes. While personal auto insurance doesn't cover a vehicle being used for business purposes, commercial auto insurance covers your vehicle for both commercial and personal use.
What drivers are covered under commercial auto insurance?
Drivers with regular access to your commercial vehicle should be named on your policy. Additional drivers may be covered, but restrictions apply for anybody not listed on the policy.
Are tools and materials in my vehicle covered under a commercial auto policy?
It depends. Permanently attached tools and equipment are covered by a commercial auto policy, but any additional tools require inland marine insurance . You can add inland marine insurance to your general liability policy.
Do I need commercial auto insurance to drive for a rideshare company, like Lyft or Uber?
In most cases, no. Rideshare companies typically offer insurance when you're driving for them, but it may have restrictions. To make sure you're well protected, you can add coverage to your personal auto insurance through policy amendments called endorsements. You could also get commercial for-hire livery insurance. Learn more about your rideshare insurance options.
Do I need special insurance to deliver pizza or other goods for a fee?
Yes, most likely. Most personal auto insurance policies won't cover losses while delivering for a fee, including pizza delivery and most other delivery services. Your claim might be denied if you don't have commercial auto insurance and get into a work-related accident. You could also be held personally responsible for the damages. A commercial auto policy can prevent this from happening.
How much will my insurance go up if I'm involved in an accident with my commercial vehicle?
It depends. An accident doesn't affect the rate of your current policy, but it could affect your rate at renewal. Your policy is rewritten every time it expires to reflect your current situation. Accident-related rate changes are determined by various factors, such as who was at fault, the cost of the claim, and your accident history. So, accidents are considered when determining your rate, but an increase isn't guaranteed.
Does commercial auto insurance cover theft of personal items?
Not necessarily. A commercial auto policy covers the vehicle and any permanently attached items, such as a ladder rack or a truck bed toolbox, but it doesn't cover the ladders and tools themselves. For the contents of your vehicle to be covered, you'd need a general liability policy with an inland marine endorsement.
Does Progressive offer commercial auto insurance in my state?
Yes. Progressive insures commercial vehicles in all 50 states . However, we don't currently write policies in Washington, D.C.

Electricians
Plumbers

If you work as an independent contractor and make deliveries using your commercial van, your employer may provide insurance to protect the goods you transport in your cargo or delivery van. They may also provide liability insurance to cover you while you're working.
Be sure to ask your employer about what coverages they provide because you might only be protected when you're on the job.
Commercial van insurance coverages
The most common commercial van insurance coverages are liability insurance and physical damage coverage:
Liability insurance covers your business and cargo vans when you or your employees drive them. This coverage pays for injuries or damage to other people or property if you're at fault for an accident.
Physical damage coverage can protect your van if it is damaged in an accident. Having enough coverage on your business van insurance policy can help you avoid losing business or profit if something happens to one of your commercial vans.

What is tow truck insurance?
A tow truck business earns income by hauling disabled vehicles. If that's what you do, you should carry customized tow truck insurance. Towing insurance is a type of specialized commercial truck coverage that can financially safeguard your business by protecting your vehicles, drivers, and the property of others in the event of an accident.
Who needs tow truck insurance?
If you use a truck to tow other vehicles, even if it's not your main business function, you need insurance for towing. Businesses that should consider tow truck coverage include:
Roadside service providers
Auto club contractors
Rotational towing
Auto body shops
Auto mechanical repair
Full-service stations
Auto salvage and auction haulers
With so much riding on your tow truck, it's vital that you have coverage adjusted specifically for your needs. Speak to an experienced agent or start an online quote to get a tailored tow truck policy.
Tow truck insurance requirements
For-hire tow trucks larger than 10,000 pounds are mandated by FMCSA regulations to have minimum liability coverage of $750,000. Some locations have higher minimums than the FMCSA. See truck insurance requirements by state to find out how much liability you need to carry.
Trucks used to tow company or customer vehicles on private property are not subject to the same federal requirements, but you'll have to follow state laws for minimum vehicle liability limits.
Essential coverage for tow truck businesses
Towing insurance needs to account for potential damage to towed vehicles and other roadside risks. Tow truck companies often carry the following:
Liability insurance
Liability insurance helps cover costs if you're responsible for injuring someone or damaging their property in an accident. It includes bodily injury and property damage coverage.
If your tow truck causes an accident, bodily injury liability covers the other person's medical expenses and legal fees. Property damage liability coverage helps with repairs or replacements for anything your truck hits.
Physical damage coverage
Physical damage insurance includes collision and comprehensive coverage, which protect your tow truck from a range of risks.
Collision coverage helps pay for repairs if your truck hits something, like another vehicle or a utility pole. Comprehensive coverage protects your truck from things like theft, fire, vandalism, weather damage, or hitting an animal. For some heavy trucks, there's also a more basic option called fire and theft , which covers specific non-collision events.
Medical payments insurance
MedPay covers medical bills for you and your passengers in case they're hurt in an accident or auto-related injury.
Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance (UM/UIM)
UM and UIM insurance protects you if you and your passengers are injured by drivers who don't have insurance or adequate coverage. It also covers cases of a hit-and-run.
Specialized coverage for towing and storage businesses
Along with basic liability and core coverages, you'll want to consider the following specialized commercial truck insurance coverages for your tow trucks:
Garagekeepers legal liability
Garagekeepers legal liability protects your customers' vehicles when they're parked on your property. It pays for damage caused by vandalism, theft, or a collision. In Texas and Virginia, this coverage is called storage location insurance. If you have multiple locations, each must be insured separately.
On-hook towing insurance
On-hook towing insurance can be added to your liability policy to cover your customers' vehicles while you're towing them. If a car is damaged by theft, fire, or vandalism, this coverage will pay to repair it.
Roadside general liability insurance
Roadside general liability coverage helps protect you if someone else gets hurt or their property is damaged while you're providing roadside services.
How much is tow truck insurance?
In 2024, the median monthly cost of tow truck insurance was $380 for new Progressive Commercial customers. The average premium was $619 per month. ‡‡
Most customers pay closer to the median rate because expensive outliers drive up the average cost. So, what can you expect to spend?
Tow truck insurance cost factors
Many factors influence your wrecker insurance cost, including:
Tow truck type and age
Your location
Type of towing
Driving record
Claims history
Coverage limits
