Commercial Auto Liability Insurance
Protection When an Accident Occurs
Commercial Auto Liability insurance is at the heart of every commercial truck insurance policy. Sometimes it is referred to as Trucking Liability. It is the part of your truck insurance policy that responds when your truck is involved in an accident with another party. Auto Liability can safeguard your business by covering the cost of damage to other people’s vehicles and property, medical expenses related to the accident, and your legal defense if your company is sued.
You’ll find Auto Liability insurance in nearly every trucking insurance policy because it is required for almost every semi-truck on the road. A trucking company must have a minimum of $750,000 in Auto Liability coverage to operate as an interstate carrier in the United States. And motor carriers who haul hazardous cargo are required to maintain $5,000,000 in Auto Liability.

WHY YOU NEED COMMERCIAL AUTO LIABILITY INSURANCE
In a nutshell, when a truck driver hits another vehicle on the road, the motor carrier may be responsible for paying for the damages that arise from the accident. Commercial Auto Liability coverage, also known as trucking Auto Liability, can protect motor carriers from the legal liability that comes along with the ownership and use of their commercial truck.
YOU NEED TRUCKING AUTO LIABILITY COVERAGE IF YOU:
Own or operate a commercial truck or company vehicle
Provide hauling or freight services
Transport or deliver goods
GET YOUR TRUCK’S AUTO LIABILITY COVERAGE FROM A COMPANY THAT GETS TRUCKING.
WHAT AUTO LIABILITY COVERS
A motor carrier’s Auto Liability coverage kicks in when you, your employees, or your contract drivers are responsible for causing an accident in your insured truck.
Your commercial auto liability policy has two major components that protect your business: Bodily Injury and Property Damage.
Bodily Injury coverage takes care of medical-related expenses arising from an injury or death, including medical and hospital bills, rehabilitation services, physical therapy, long-term nursing care, lost earnings, funeral expenses, and pain and suffering. Bodily Injury also pays your legal defense if your company is sued.
Property Damage coverage takes care of the repair or replacement of property that is damaged in the accident, including, buildings, signs, and personal property. It also covers your legal defense if you’re sued.
What auto liability doesn't cover
Trucking Auto Liability doesn’t pay for damage to your truck caused by an accident. It also doesn’t provide protection for your truck, trailer, or cargo from theft, fire, vandalism, or other disasters. A Trucking Auto Liability policy is designed, instead, to protect your business from liability for injury to others or damage to the property of others.
AUTO LIABILITY COVERAGE ENDORSEMENTS
Endorsements are ways to modify your trucking insurance policy. Great West offers two popular endorsements to our trucking Auto Liability policy.
Reporting policy options for Auto Liability insurance and Physical Damage insurance.
Great West's Commercial Auto Extension endorsement, providing blanket coverage for certain types of trucking contracts and agreements.
Commercial Auto Extension Endorsement
Great West’s auto liability policy might not cover exposures you assume under a loan, lease agreement, or contract. In fact, many contracts and agreements are not insured and may expose you to unwanted legal action. There are two types of common agreements that are normally excluded from your auto liability coverage:
A contract or agreement for the loan, lease, or rental of an auto; the terms require you to hold the lessor harmless for any liability loss.
A contract or agreement you sign when trip leasing to another truck driver; the terms require you to provide primary liability insurance.
Great West can provide blanket coverage for these two types of contracts by adding the Commercial Auto Extension endorsement to your auto liability insurance policy. This endorsement provides affordable insurance protection while you meet that next deadline.
RECOMMENDED INSURANCE FOR OWNER-OPERATORS
If you are an owner-operator and have an office or multiple trucks on the road, you should also consider General Liability insurance , which covers additional liability claims that can arise in the operation of a trucking company, such as personal accidents on company property.

physical damage insurance
TRUCK INSURANCE COVERAGE TO GET YOU BACK ON THE ROAD
Physical Damage insurance is the part of your trucking insurance policy that covers your commercial truck and equipment when you have an accident. It pays to fix or replace the tractors, trailers, and equipment you own or lease that are damaged in a crash. It covers your truck 24/7.
PRODUCTS + SERVICES
Alternative Risk Programs Auto Liability Cargo Coverage Claims Services Excess Policies General Liability National Accounts Owner-Operators Physical Damage Safety + Risk Control Specialty Coverages Workers Compensation
WHAT’S COVERED BY PHYSICAL DAMAGE INSURANCE?
When your truck is in an accident or you have an equipment loss not including mechanical breakdown, Physical Damage insurance includes two types of protection:
Collision coverage , which covers losses from an overturn or accident, and
Comprehensive coverage , which covers other non-collision-related equipment losses. This is coverage for almost any damages incurred by a truck, including fire, natural disasters, wind damage, animal-related damage, glass breakage, robbery, theft, and vandalism.
Great West’s Physical Damage insurance automatically includes coverage for these accident-related expenses:
Truck and equipment repair or replacement
Towing expenses
Tarps, chains, and binders damaged on an owned trailer
Payments for certain fluids
Downtime coverage
Single Deductible endorsement
GET TRUCK INSURANCE FROM A COMPANY THAT UNDERSTANDS TRUCKING
OUR REPAIR SHOP RELATIONSHIPS
Getting your tractor trailer and equipment back in action quickly means being able to find a qualified, reliable repair shop. Our long-term relationships with established repair facilities, towing companies, and parts suppliers mean your equipment will get the attention it deserves no matter where you are.
Great West can also accommodate special situations in which your own maintenance staff is qualified to make repairs.
DOWNTIME COVERAGE
If your truck is in the repair shop for an extended period of time, you’re not making money. To protect you if your truck is not drivable, we include Downtime coverage that provides you $450 per week for a maximum of eight weeks or until the repairs are completed and the vehicle is determined to be roadworthy, whichever occurs first.
Great West includes Downtime Coverage as a part of our motor carrier Physical Damage and Non-Trucking Use Physical Damage coverage at no extra charge to you. It is not available on Business Auto coverage.
Downtime Coverage has a 35-day waiting period that begins when three conditions are met:
Great West has given the approval to repair;
You have given the repair facility the approval to repair; and
Your equipment is out of service for repair because of a covered loss and is in the custody of the repair facility.
There is no Downtime Coverage for a stolen vehicle, a total loss or constructive total loss, or while reserve or spare trucks are available.
PHYSICAL DAMAGE SINGLE DEDUCTIBLE ENDORSEMENT INCLUDED
When you have an accident and sustain damage to your tractor, trailer, and cargo, you could have as many as three Physical Damage insurance deductibles that apply. Great West provides a Single Deductible endorsement, which allows you to have one deductible, reducing your out-of-pocket costs.
Best yet, our Single Deductible endorsement is offered at no cost to you as a part of our Physical Damage policy.
HOW A SINGLE DEDUCTIBLE ENDORSEMENT WORKS
For example, in a typical accident, you could have a deductible of $2,500 on your tractor, $2,500 on your trailer, and $2,500 on your cargo. If it were a covered loss, instead of $7,500 in deductibles that could apply in this claim, Great West’s single deductible would use the highest of the available deductibles — in this case, $2,500.
GET ALL THE PROTECTION THAT YOUR OPERATION NEEDS
PHYSICAL DAMAGE POLICY CUSTOMIZATIONS
Endorsements are ways to modify your trucking insurance policy. Great West offers a number of optional endorsements to its Physical Damage coverage. These give you added flexibility to customize your policy to meet the specific operational needs of your trucking business.
TRUCKING PHYSICAL DAMAGE OPTIONAL COVERAGES
A bundled package that includes towing, electronic equipment coverage, rental reimbursement, emergency expenses, mechanical breakdown, and miscellaneous equipment coverage.
Covers electronic equipment such as computers, and other communication devices on or in a covered auto.
Covers the cost of renting replacement tractors, trucks, and trailers when a loss occurs to equipment covered under your Physical Damage policy.
Extends Physical Damage coverage to trailers covered under a written intermodal agreement.
Covers loss to a covered truck or its equipment from any cause except collision or overturn. This includes damage from a hazardous materials leak or from cargo shifting.
Cover the cost to pay off a lease or loan when the cost exceeds your unit’s actual cash value.
Covers the hired auto physical damage exposures an insured may have for commercial trucks they hire or borrow.
This coverage is available if you need to apply a maximum or aggregate for all deductibles as a result of a single-covered Physical Damage loss.
HIRED AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE
When you hire or rent a commercial truck, you are responsible for any damage to it. That’s why Great West offers Hired Auto Physical Damage coverage to protect you from the loss exposure you may have for autos your business hires or borrows. A hired auto is a covered auto owned by someone other than you, hired by or rented to you, for a special purpose on a short-term basis. This coverage can be purchased for trucks, tractors, and trailers, private passenger-type autos, or both.
Comprehensive
Specified Causes of Loss
or Collision.
While your fleet may be insured for Specified Causes of Loss, you should consider buying Comprehensive and Collision as your responsibility for damage to hired autos may require broader protection.
One limit of insurance applies to all covered trucks for the actual cash value of all trucks combined.
The definition of a covered trailer includes shipping containers.
Our coverage does not pick up damages for loss of use of a hired truck that may be asserted by the owner. That is a business risk you assume.
When determining the total limit of insurance, you should purchase a limit for the worst-case scenario. Since this coverage is separate from what you are buying for your owned or leased equipment, you may also choose a deductible different from that which applies to owned units.
PHYSICAL DAMAGE LOCATION COVERAGE
Great West can help you minimize single-location physical damage losses your business could face. Our trucking Physical Damage Location coverage endorsement is available if you need to apply a maximum or aggregate for all deductibles as a result of a single-covered physical damage loss. We offer this coverage endorsement by applying a per-loss deductible.
For example, 20 parked tractors and 50 parked trailers suffer hail damage of $5,000 per unit. If your Physical Damage policy deductible is $1,000 for each, your out-of-pocket would be $70,000. With the deductible cap created by the Physical Damage Location coverage endorsement, you can limit the deductible to $20,000, capping your loss at a more manageable level.
THE ADDED BENEFITS OF CHOOSING GREAT WEST
Great West offers trucking companies various Physical Damage coverage deductibles, self-insured retentions, location-specific catastrophic coverage, and other flexible options to match how you operate your business. And we can break down your premium into monthly payments based on gross revenue, mileage, or the value of your equipment.

specialty trucking coverages
BULK AND TANK CARRIERS + FREIGHT CONCERNS
At Great West, providing specialty truck insurance coverages is what we do day in and day out. That’s because insuring trucking businesses is our only business. We’ve spent more than 65 years immersed in the trucking industry and developing insurance coverage tuned to address the risks associated with specific trucking operations and cargo.

PRODUCTS + SERVICES
Alternative Risk Programs Auto Liability Cargo Coverage Claims Services Excess Policies General Liability National Accounts Owner-Operators Physical Damage Safety + Risk Control Specialty Coverages Workers Compensation
BULK COMMODITY CARRIER INSURANCE
For bulk commodity carriers, Great West’s specialty coverage provides a multi-pronged approach to protecting your operation, your cargo, and your trucks.
Advantages of a Great West policy
We insure bulk commodity carriers of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials.
Our bulk commodity carrier coverage protects nearly every aspect of your bulk commodity operation.
Our Commercial General Liability policy for bulk commodity carriers includes important coverages that you’ll find are often excluded by other insurance providers. For example, when a truck delivery is complete, any subsequent bodily injury or property damage loss is still covered by our policy without the need for additional endorsements.
Great West’s Cargo Coverage for tank haulers really stands out as well. Our Cargo policy covers losses that include loading, unloading, or damage to cargo from misdelivery, such as gasoline that’s emptied into the wrong tank.
Our Physical Damage coverage has no restrictions on stainless steel or insulated tankers.
Our Auto Liability policy covers losses related to cargo pollution, such as liquid or gas spreading over land after a semi truck has overturned.
Repairs to tank trailers can be time-consuming, so Great West's auto policy also includes coverage for downtime.
We can meet the financial requirements for hazmat filings.
FROM A COMPANY THAT REALLY UNDERSTANDS TRUCKING
FREIGHT BROKER COVERAGE
As a freight broker, we recognize that you have unique insurance needs because you are acting as a freight agent for your shippers. Freight brokers are required to register with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and supply evidence of a $75,000 surety bond.
That’s why we’ve developed several specialty truck insurance coverages to meet the needs of freight brokerages.
Great West Freight Broker insurance options include:
Auto Liability and Cargo Coverage for Brokers,
Motor Carriers - Named Broker as Insured coverage (including Cargo), and
Second-Level Coverage Endorsement, which provides you protection in excess of what is required by the motor carrier in your contractual agreement.
FREIGHT FORWARDER COVERAGE
As a freight forwarder, you act as a common carrier for your shippers. That means you also have special insurance requirements to protect your business. In addition, you have to provide motor carrier filings and register with the FMCSA as a freight forwarder.
That’s why we’ve specifically designed several specialty truck insurance coverages to protect freight forwarders.
Great West Freight Forwarder coverage options include:
Auto Liability and Cargo Coverage for Freight Forwarders,
Motor Carriers - Named Freight Forwarders as Insured coverage; and
Second-Level Coverage Endorsement, which provides your business protection in excess of what is required by your motor carrier in your contractual agreement.
Because freight forwarders are required to have liability filings with the FMCSA, we save you time and effort by making those filings for you. Great West will also issue an MCS-90 endorsement, if appropriate.

GET THE BEST OWNER OPERATOR INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR YOUR BUSINESS
Every trucking operation is unique, and there are different ways to approach owner operator insurance coverage to maximize your protection while minimizing your premium.

Are you under permanent lease to a motor carrier or do you work under your own authority?
Do you own or lease your tractors?
Do you have employees who drive for you?
Do you have an office or shop?
What type of freight do you haul?
What routes do you travel?
GET  Insurance for OWNER OPERATORs FROM A COMPANY THAT UNDERSTANDS TRUCKING
WHILE OPERATING UNDER YOUR OWN AUTHORITY
To determine owner operator insurance cost, it is important to understand what  specific coverages you need. Here are some of the common components of a commercial truck insurance policy for independent owner operators who have their own authority. We help you select only the coverage you need to fit your business and operational needs.
REQUIRED AUTO LIABILITY COVERAGE:
Auto Liability coverage: Owner operators with their own authority must have an Auto Liability policy (sometimes called Primary Liability) with a minimum of $750,000 in coverage to operate as an interstate carrier in the United States. Many shippers and freight brokers require a minimum of $1,000,000 in coverage to haul for them.
Workers Compensation coverage: If you have employees, many states require that you have coverage for drivers and clerical employees regardless of your independent contractor status.
OWNER OPERATOR INSURANCE COVERAGE:
General Liability coverage: protects your business from third-party accidents or losses on your premises as a result of your operations
Physical Damage coverage: Physical Damage insurance covers damage to your semi truck and equipment when you have an accident
Passenger Accident coverage: medical coverage for passengers riding along with you
Trailer Interchange coverage : Physical Damage coverage for owned and non-owned trailers
Equipment coverage: insures your electronic equipment while inside or attached to your truck and covers binders, tarps, tie-downs, chains, and other equipment when you don’t own the trailer
Cargo coverage: insures the cargo and freight you haul
Motor Carrier Reimbursement coverage: covers property loss for which you’re contractually responsible to a motor carrier
Mechanical Breakdown coverage: covers towing and roadside labor due to a mechanical breakdown
Emergency Expense coverage: covers expenses due to a mechanical breakdown, including lodging, meals, vehicle rental, and more
Downtime coverage: provides coverage when your truck is in the repair shop and not drivable
Rental Reimbursement coverage: activates when you need to rent tractors, trucks, and trailers after an accident
Lease Value and Financed Value coverage: provides coverage when the cost to pay off your lease or loan after a total loss exceeds your unit’s actual cash value
Excess coverage: coverage limits above your other liability coverage to shield your trucking company’s financial assets from catastrophic loss
WHILE OPERATING UNDER PERMANENT LEASE
As an owner operator, when you’re leased to a motor carrier, you’re typically insured under the motor carrier’s Auto Liability policy.
It’s important to know that you’re only covered by their policy when you’re operating under your lease and their Auto Liability policy only covers injuries to other people and damage to the property of others if the motor carrier is held liable for the accident.
The motor carrier’s coverage does not cover damage to your truck.
That’s why owner operators under permanent lease need their own owner operator insurance coverage. We select coverages to specifically fill the gaps that could put your livelihood at risk – either by having to pay for damages or from a lawsuit – as the result of an accident.
In addition to the coverages discussed above, here are common additions for owner operators under lease:
Non-trucking Use (NTU) coverage: provides liability coverage for when you’re using the truck for non-business purposes, like stopping at the store or running errands
CHOICE COVERAGE ® PLUS
A bundle of trucking insurance endorsements designed to protect owner operators with one to nine units. Choice Coverage ® Plus includes Electronic Equipment coverage, Personal Property coverage, Miscellaneous Equipment coverage, and Mechanical Breakdown coverage, plus a Diminishing Deductible that rewards owner operators who operate safe and loss-free.
