Huff and Puff Trucking
Insuring for the long haul
A family business
For Bruce Daniel, running a successful trucking company isnât just about a healthy bottom line. Itâs about family and community. Investing in both today to help ensure a promising tomorrow.
Huff and Puff Trucking began in 1983, working with agricultural operations in the greater middle Tennessee region. Over time, theyâve grown into a flatbed carrier with about 100 trucks serving customers in 48 states and Canada.
This is very much a family business. Bruce oversees it with his wife, Melody, and their three sonsâT.J., B.J. and A.J.âwho hold leadership roles in logistics, marketing, and maintenance. Then there are the employees, who Bruce also treats like family.
Bruce says having good employees is the heart and soul of his business.
âIt's about all these people and all the hard work they do. The phone calls in the middle of the night and the breakdowns and taking care of the customer service and the customer,â said Bruce. âWe pride ourselves on doing quality work. We're not interested in being the biggest, but we are interested in being the best.â
A culture of safety
To be the best, Huff and Puff focuses on safety, training, and putting skilled professionals behind the wheel. And they align themselves with an insurance carrier who shares those priorities.
Sentry has provided insurance coverage for Huff and Puff for the past 10 years. During that time, Bruce and team have revamped their driver training program with a focus on efficiency and safety. Calling it Huff and Puff University, Bruce says it goes above and beyond other driver programs to add skilled professional drivers to their team.
âWe do our best to get the right employees in the driverâs seat,â Bruce said. âAnd when we do have claims, we know that the longer a claim sits unresolved, the more expensive it gets. We rely on Sentry and their expertise to get our claims resolved and, at the end of the day, get these trucks back out on the road.â
Building for the future
Although the daily operations of a trucking company occupy much of Bruceâs time, he keeps an eye on the future when his sons eventually will lead the company. He said itâs important to him to nurture long-term relationships with businesses like Sentry, whoâll offer continued insight and support down the road.
âWeâve got to have somebody to depend on that will be there when we need them,â said Bruce. âThis is not just about meâit's all the families that are represented here in this company. They depend on the company to take care of them. And if things go wrong, youâve got to have somebody in your corner who will go to bat for you."
The results
For Huff and Puff Trucking, that dependable resource is Sentry, said Bruce. âWe consider you a trusted partner and friend.â

Commercial auto insurance
Auto accidents happenâsometimes even when weâve done nothing wrong. If your customers or employees drive as part of your day-to-day business activities, we have commercial auto insurance products to cover your business and your employees if an accident does happen. Our flexible auto coverage options will also help protect any vehicles you lease, rent, or own for business use.
The Sentry difference
We tailor our products to your business
Just as individual drivers have varying personal auto insurance coverages, your commercial auto policy shouldnât be the same as every other business auto policy. Whether you need standard coverages like collision, comprehensive, and liability, or you need something extra, weâll work with you to help determine commercial auto coverage for your business.
Claims made easier
Weâre here for you 24/7 when you need to file a claim.
